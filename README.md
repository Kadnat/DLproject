# Data Logger project

## Internship Project

This repository represents the work accomplished during my 12-week internship at the University of Winnipeg. It aims to develop a low-cost system for the long-distance transmission of data from various environmental sensors. Various technologies were compared and tested to determine their advantages and disadvantages. The alliance between LoRa and Cellular technology was selected, enabling reliable, long-distance transmission at a very low cost.

## Project Structure

- **4G board ThingSpeak**: Contains the code for the Maduino 4G LTE board.
- **4G board GSheet**: Contains test drafts for using the system with Google Sheets.
- **3D files**: Contains STL files used to create the boxes for the sender and receiver.
- **electronic diagrams**: Contains draw.io diagrams to represent the system.
- **firmware boards**: Contains the firmware used on the RP2040 boards and the libraries.
- **User Manual**: Contains documentation on how to use the project.
- **receiver**: Contains the code used on the RP2040 receiver node.
- **sender 1602LCD**: Contains the code for the sender node using an LCD1602 screen.
- **sender ssd1306**: Contains the same code as the sender 1602LCD but for use with an OLED 1306 screen.
